# Template for Expo SQLite + local API using useContext() and useReducer()


### TODO:
- add triggers to tables (if this doesn't work, remove timestamped fields) 
- create useReducer Actions
    behaviors: 
        getBehavior 
        createBehavior 
        updateBehavior 
        deleteBehavior 
    ... and for remaining tables 
    Note: for passing the payload may need to destructure when inserting data into functions
